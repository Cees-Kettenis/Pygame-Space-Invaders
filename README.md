Hello!

My name is Cees,

This week i followed an other great tutorial by Clear Code : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-6pADy5Mdg&ab_channel=ClearCode

Once again i improved the game slighly by making it gradually harder as you progress through the levels and an infinite gameloop until you run out of lives

Feel free to use my code and improve upon it yourself!

If you just want to play it download the zip in the dist folder and unzip it. Find the exe and enjoy!
